Centres is an open source Java library for that allows perception and labelling of stereogenic centres in chemical structures.

### Functionality
* Perception and labelling of tetrahedral (__R__/__S__) and planar (__Z__/__E__) stereogenic centres
* Identification of pseudoasymetric centres _r_, _s_, _z_ and _e_
* Complete implementation of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules as they appear in Prelog and Helmchen, 1982
* Customizable priority rules that allow perception with alternate priorities such as those suggested by Predih and Rmzinger, 1994 
* Generic library allowing [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) of any molecule/atom object representation
