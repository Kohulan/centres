# Stereochemistry Labelling Done Good

Centres is an Open Source Java library for that allows perception and labelling of stereogenic centres in chemical structures using the [Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog_priority_rules).

### Key Features
* Generic library allowing [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) of any molecule/atom object representation. Currently
supported 'endpoints':
  * [Chemistry Development Kit](github.com/cdk/cdk)
  * [OPSIN](https://bitbucket.org/dan2097/opsin/)
* Perception and labelling of tetrahedral (__R__/__S__/__r__/__s__) and geometric double bonds (__Z__/__E__).
* Implementation of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules as they appear in Prelog and Helmchen, 1982
* Implementation of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules as they appear in Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013
